# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Includes C++ programming projects completed as part of the ECE 250 -Data Structures and Algorithms course taken at the University of Waterloo.

A description of each project is given below:

Project 1: 
The goal of this project is to write a C++ program that manages a playlist of songs. The program allows the user to add songs to this list (at the end of the list), and select a song 
to be played.

Project 2 - Hash Tables: 
The goal of this project is to write a C++ implementation for hash table data structure. In this data structure, values are mapped to a position in a table using a hash function. For this
project, I have implemented a hash table in which collisions are resolve using two different techniques: (i) open addressing using linear probing and (ii) separate chaining where the
chains are unordered.

Project 3 - Quad Tree:
The goal of this project is to write a C++ implementation for a Quadtree that stores informations related to cities based on their latitudes and longitudes. Each node of the tree
holds information such as population, cost of living, and average net salary.

Project 4 - Graphs:
The goal of this project is to write a C++ implementation to find shortest path in a graph using Dijktsraâ€™s algorithm. Using this, a user can find the shortest path between two given cities using an undirected graph.
